# lcr

A basic library for running lcr (left-center-right) game simulations

## Description

This library can run simulations of LCR games and return winner distribution data. This can help you ask the very simple question: which player is most likely to win? I created this back in 2017 in MATLAB, but I played it again at Christmas so I wanted to update it to a more familiar language.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* numpy
* tabulate
* matplotlib

### Installing

* Just clone the github repo.

### Executing program

* `usage: main.py [-h] [--print] [--graph] [--save] players trials`

```
python lcr.py [-h] [--print] [--graph] [--save] players trials
```
